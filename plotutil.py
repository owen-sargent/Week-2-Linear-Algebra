    """
    Plot a line whose segments are colored by a force magnitude using the "inferno" colormap.

    It does this by creating a collection of line segments between each pair of
    neighboring points. The color of each segment is determined by the
    force values. Each segment is made up of two straight lines each connecting the current (x, y) point to the
    midpoints of the lines connecting the current point with its two neighbors.
    This creates a smooth line with no gaps between the line segments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array-like
        The horizontal and vertical coordinates of the data points.
    force : array-like
        The force/tension for each segment, which **should have a size one less
        than that of x and y**. These values are mapped to the "inferno" colormap
        from their min to their max.
    ax : Axes
        Axis object on which to plot the colored line.
    clabel : str, optional
        Label to apply to the colorbar. If None, the colorbar is left unlabeled.
    **lc_kwargs
        Any additional arguments to pass to matplotlib.collections.LineCollection
        constructor. This should not include the array or cmap keyword arguments
        because those are set from the force argument. If provided, they will be
        overridden.

    Returns
    -------
    line : matplotlib.collections.LineCollection
        The generated line collection representing the colored line.
